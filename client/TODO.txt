- add support for disconnected scenarios

- do perfbase put better; can all the queued http put's be combined
  into a single put?

- make it so you can invoke mtt from anywhere, not just "./mtt" (i.e.,
  it currenty runs "use cwd()/lib;".  Need a more sensible way to find
  the MTT perl libraries.

- be able to handle case where svn checkouts go badly and svn
  ends up waiting for input (E.g., username or password).  Should be
  able to detect this somehow and know to kill it.

- add pre_hook and post_hook to all sub modules that run before the
  main action and after the main action; intent is to [optionally]
  give some arguments sufficient to launch another engine.pl in the
  next phase (e.g., have a post_hook to BuildMPI that runs engline.pl
  in the BuildTests phase).

- make centralized database download set of constants for the db
  (e.g., how many lines of stderr to report, etc.)

- figure out "get" phase better to determine if we need a new MPI
    source or not
    - some can tell immediately
    - some cannot tell without remote access
    would be better to put all the nasty compare logic up in Get.pm
    directly instead of in each module

- audit test builds / data in, out, reported, saved

- need a lockfile to protect all the XML files in case multiple
  engines running simultaneously

- add trimming functionality: deleting old builds
    - put real timestamps in saved xml; delete trees older than a
      given date?

- test build source is not cached like MPI source
  --> have to go get it for every build (e.g., from svn), which won't
      necessarily work on compute nodes
